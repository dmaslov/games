games
=====

simple games written in Python:

+pong

+stopwatch

+rpslS (rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)

requires
========

All Games, except rpslS, require Tkinter library. It should already be installed by default.

If for some reason is not, install python-tk library via apt-get.

In python 3 Tkinter library has been renamed from "Tkinter" to "tkinter", so if you run some of the games under python 3, you need to change "from Tkinter import *" string to "from tkinter import *".

run
========

To run one of game you need:

make it executable (chmod +x /path/to/file/filename.py) and run it by command (/path/to/file/filename.py)

or

run it by command (python /path/to/file/filename.py)
